# Arduino-LED
Level-1-- make the LED flash slow three times (1000 mS delay), then quickly three times. (100 mS delay)
Level-2-- flash your initials using Morse code (See chart below). A “dot” would have the LED on for 100 mS and for a dash the LED would be on for 1000 mS
Level-3-- A program that alternates between the blue LED1 and red LED2, to simulate an emergency vehicle.
